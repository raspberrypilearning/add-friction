In the Project window select 'Materials' and then 'PhysicsMaterials'. Right-click in the window, click 'Create' and select **Physic Material**. 

Give your physics material a sensible name. 

Adjust the properties to create the effect you want:

+ **Dynamic friction ** - A value from 0-1. Friction when moving. 0 is like ice. 1 is hard to slow down.
+ **Static friction ** - A value from 0-1. Friction from still on a surface. 0 is like ice. 1 is hard to slow down.
+ **Bounce ** - A value from 0-1. 0 will not bounce. 1 will keep bouncing without losing energy.

Drag the material onto one or more GameObjects.
